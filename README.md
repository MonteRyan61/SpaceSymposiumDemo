## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Markup language used to structure the web page and define its content.
- **CSS**: Styling language used to enhance the visual appearance of the web page and create responsive layouts.
- **JavaScript**: Programming language used to implement interactive functionality and logic for the trivia game, such as displaying questions, handling user input, and calculating scores.

With proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you'll be well-equipped to explore more advanced frameworks, libraries, and technologies in the field of web development.

## Advanced Technologies

After mastering the basics of web development with this project, there are several paths you can explore to further expand your skills and knowledge:

1. **Front-End Frameworks**: Dive into popular front-end frameworks such as React, Vue.js, or Angular to build more dynamic user interfaces

2. **Back-End Development**: Explore back-end technologies such as Node.js, Python Django to build server-side logic to handle data storage and retrieval, and create APIs for your web applications.

3. **Database Management**: Database management systems such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB to store and manipulate data efficiently.

By continuing to explore and learn new technologies, frameworks, and tools, you'll be able to build more complex web applications.

## Challenges to Expand Your Skills

After cloning the repository and becoming familiar with the project structure, here are some challenges:

1. **Add More Questions**: Expand the trivia game by adding more questions and options related to space exploration, satellite technology, or other aerospace topics.

2. **Enhance User Experience**: Improve the overall user interface and experience by adding animations, sound effects, or visual enhancements to make the game more engaging and immersive. Consider implementing features such as progress indicators, feedback animations, and themed backgrounds.

3. **Implement Timer**: Implement a timer feature to add a time constraint for answering each question, making the game more challenging.
   
4. **Database Management**: Design and implement database functionality to store and manage user data, allowing for features like user authentication, score tracking, and leaderboard display.

5. **API Integration**: Implement an API to fetch trivia questions dynamically and integrate database management to store user scores, leaderboards, or personalized trivia questions. Utilize existing trivia APIs such as Open Trivia Database (https://opentdb.com/) or create your own custom API to retrieve questions tailored to specific topics or interests.
